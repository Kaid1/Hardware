Wild Animals: Where else in Europe could you hope to encounter wild bears, wolves, lynx and flying squirrels? Nowhere.

Birds: Millions of birds stop in Estonia on their migratory paths.

Castles: Restored or in ruins, there are medieval castles not just in Tallinn but across the country.

Saunas: When it’s snowing take a hot log sauna, beat yourself (or a friend) with a birch branch and then roll around in the snow. It’s fun. Really.

Ghosts and Legends: Estonia has its fair share of spooky and supernatural happenings. The Old Town of Tallinn, for example, is full of stories and strange experiences.
