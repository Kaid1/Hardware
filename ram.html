    Medieval Old Town Tallinn: It’s impossible to deny that this is the main reason most people first come to Estonia – to see the best protected and intact medieval city in Europe.

Deserted Beaches: Estonia’s coastline has hundreds of deserted beaches. Even in the height of summer you can find private space for yourself.

Manor Houses: Luxurious manor houses, built over the centuries, are open for visitors and many also have been converted to high-class hotels.

Forests: Estonia is about 50% forest. Hiking trails criss-cross the forests, many of which are protected or part of National Parks.
